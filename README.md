Use cases

This layout is well suited for application-style interfaces where users
work with content over extended periods of time.

Typical use cases include:

Notes applications
Managing notes, documents, or markdown files with fast navigation and
focused editing areas.

Dashboards
Analytics, monitoring tools, and internal dashboards with multiple
application sections.

SaaS products
Web applications that require persistent navigation across different
functional areas.

Admin panels
Backoffice systems, CMS interfaces, and management tools.

Developer tools
Configuration-heavy tools where navigation should remain accessible
without distracting from the main workflow.

This layout is not intended for marketing websites, landing pages,
or content-only websites where navigation should be minimized.
